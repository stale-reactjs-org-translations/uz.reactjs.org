### Guidelines

The documentation is divided into several sections with a different tone and purpose. If you plan to write more than a few sentences, you might find it helpful to get familiar with the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines-for-text) for the appropriate sections.

### Create a branch

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. `git checkout main` from any folder in your local `uz.reactjs.org` repository

1. `git pull origin main` to ensure you have the latest main code
1. `git checkout -b the-name-of-my-branch` (replacing `the-name-of-my-branch` with a suitable name) to create a branch

### Make the change

1. Follow the ["Running locally"](#running-locally) instructions
1. Save the files and check in the browser

### Test the change

1. If possible, test any visual changes in all latest versions of common browsers, on both desktop and mobile.
2. Run `yarn check-all`. (This will run Prettier, ESLint and validate types.)

### Push it

1. `git add -A && git commit -m "My message"` (replacing `My message` with a commit message, such as `Fix header logo on Android`) to stage and commit your changes
1. `git push my-fork-name the-name-of-my-branch`
